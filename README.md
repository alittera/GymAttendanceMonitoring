# Gym-Attendance-Monitoring

Gym-Attendance-Monitoring is a proof of concept of an android application which tracks the user through the gym to monitor the use of the rooms and to have a customer loyalty system. 
The project is part of the Internet of things course held at the Sapienza University of Rome.

For the correct functioning it is necessary to own the Estimote branded beacons; Microsoft Azure and Grafana technologies will also be used.
